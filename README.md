# Bioinformatics_Data_Analysis
Microarray data related to blood cancer (leukemia), specifically acute bone marrow leukemia (AML), is analyzed in this repository.

## Data Quality Control
The initial data is prepared for analysis, including necessary changes. Data visualization is performed before and after adjustments.

## Dimension Reduction
Dimensionality reduction methods are applied to genes with similar expression levels. Different dimension reduction techniques are compared, and the best method is selected.

## Sample Correlation
Correlation between normal and AML samples is evaluated after dimension reduction. The correlation relationships between samples are visualized.

## Gene Expression Analysis
Healthy samples most correlated with AML samples are identified. Gene expression levels between the two groups are compared, and genes significantly upregulated or downregulated (p-value < 0.05) are reported.

## Gene Ontology and Pathway Analysis
For genes with altered expression in AML, related pathways and gene ontology are explored using Enrichr.
